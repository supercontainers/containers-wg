## What are the challenges that we are trying to solve?

`ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` interactions are too complex. See the [16-cell
matrix](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-cmd-and-entrypoint-interact)
in the Dockerfile reference and note its (a) large size and (b)
inconsistencies. For example, behavior differs between `ENTRYPOINT` specified
as a command line (`ENTRYPOINT foo bar`) or list (`ENTRYPOINT ["foo",
"bar"]`), and the difference between the 2nd and 3rd lines is unclear.

## What ideas do we have for how to address these challenges?

New instruction (`EXEC`?) that specifies both the command and default
arguments.

## How do these ideas break down into...

### Already existing OCI specs?


### A new project (CNCF or OCI)
If a Dockerfile spec could be created, this idea would supplement it.

## Questions?


## What pre-existing work or software can support these ideas?

## Relevant OCI Issues
