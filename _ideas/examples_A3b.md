## What are the challenges that we are trying to solve?

The OCI specs have lots of examples, but they tend to be (a) snippets of (b)
the common cases. However, implementers will have trouble with edge cases and
getting everything to work together. So, the spec needs more examples to illustrate:

* edge cases
* complete interactions, e.g. a sample image in a tarball or a complete transcript of a pull session

## What ideas do we have for how to address these challenges?

Add edge case and complete examples to the specification text.

There is some overlap here with "Conformance tests". The point here is
slightly different, though: it's to illustrate for readers tricky parts of the
spec.

## How do these ideas break down into...

### Already existing OCI specs?
This idea is relevant to all existing OCI specifications. Ideally there would be a standard means to define and display examples for the reader to quickly understand. If a documentation or similar working group is accepted this could be worked on.

### A new project (CNCF or OCI)
