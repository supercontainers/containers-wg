## What are the challenges that we are trying to solve?

White-outs are in-band with special filenames, making it impossible to simply
unpack tarballs and making those names impossible to store.

## What ideas do we have for how to address these challenges?

Store white-outs out of band, e.g. as a JSON blob accompanying a layer
tarball.

## How do these ideas break down into...

### Already existing OCI specs?


### A new project (CNCF or OCI)


## Questions?


## What pre-existing work or software can support these ideas?

## Relevant OCI Issues
